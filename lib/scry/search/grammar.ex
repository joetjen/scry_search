  Compiles this package's own `priv/grammar.aether` fragment, merges it
  with core's own grammar (`Scry.Core.Grammar.compile_unanalyzed/0` +
  `Scry.Core.GrammarCompose.merge/2`), and analyzes the result --
  `impl_spec.md` §4's own composition mechanics, exercised here by the
  first real, shipped package to fill `comparison_ep1e`'s EP1(e) infix
  comparison-tier shape at all (`scry_core`'s own third extension
  point, added alongside `select_ep1a`/`body_item_ep1`).

  **Not** the production parse path -- `Scry.Search.parse/1` calls the
  checked-in, pre-generated `Scry.Search.Grammar.Compiled` (`priv/gen/
  generate_compiled_grammar.exs` is its generator, run by hand; never
  hand-edit the generated file). `compile/0` here stays, for the same
  two reasons every other kind package's own identical function does:
  the generator script itself needs the merged-but-uncompiled grammar,
  and it's a cheap, direct way to test the merge/composition mechanics
  themselves without round-tripping through codegen.

  Uses `:code.priv_dir/1`, not a path relative to the current working
  directory -- resolves correctly both from this package's own test
  suite and from a downstream adapter depending on this package as an
  ordinary compiled dependency.

  # compiles as a dependency of a package that never declares `ichor`
  # itself, and neither is ever actually called by such a consumer.
